How Much Cheaper?

# Purpose

Braillest offers an incredibly cost effective approach to create braille, but just how much cheaper is it? The above illustrates the massive price comparison between braillest and classical printing solutions.

# Implementation

This repo is a direct clone and modification of my previous: [how-many-divs](https://github.com/ramity/how-many-divs) project where I similarly graphed a function in 3d space but has been minified down slightly.

`analysis.py` is a python script that generates price values across a range of values for both page count and book count. Price calculations are performed for braillest and classical approaches and these results are stored, graphed, imaged at several angles, and then turned into an animated gif.

# Comparison

The above shows both price planes graphed, showing the relative gap between braillest and classical.
